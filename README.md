# Bottom up Machine Learning


THis repository was created to go into the basics of programming all various kinds of machine learning approaches and methods from the bottom. It was created because i have a strong belief that a lot is lost when people only use packages like sklearn, keras, tensorflow, gensim etc. And when all this knowledge goes lost people loose the ability to solve real world problems. After i have introduced the method from the bottom up, i will show how state of the art packages can do the same in seconds. 

This is done using my spare time so it wont all come at the same time.

Here is the outline of what i want to go through so far:
Introduction
1.	Probability
2.	Model selection
3.	The curse of dimensionality
4.	Decision Theory
5.	Information Theory
Supervised learning
1.	Regression / classification (Linear and logistic classification)
2.	Bayesian
3.	Regularization
4.	Decision Trees
5.	Random Forrest
6.	Gradient Boosting
7.	Neural Networks
8.	Deep Learning
9.	Probabilistic Graphical Models
Unsupervised learning
1.	Clustering
2.	Dimensionality reduction
Reinforcement Learning
Explainable ML
1.	Evaluation metrics
2.	Surrogate models
3.	LIME
4.	SHAP

Methods can easily go under several groups, but this was the outline i found fitting. Feel free to write me if you suggest any changes.
